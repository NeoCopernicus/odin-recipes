        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Everyone needs to know how to make a classic grilled cheese sandwich.</p> 
            <p>Suitable for beginner cooks and old pros.</p>
        
        <h2>Grilled Cheese Ingredients</h2>
            <p>This classic grilled cheese sandwich recipe calls for just white bread, sliced cheese, and butter.</p> 
            <p>It's easy to switch up the bread and cheese to suit your taste preferences and, if you like, you can substitute mayonnaise for butter.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 slices white bread</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
                <li>2 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side up on top of cheese.</li>
                <li>Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slice of cheese.</li>
