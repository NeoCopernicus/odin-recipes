This was made for The Odin Project's Foundation Course Project: Recipes.
The purpose of this project is to show my understanding of the initial HTML lessons.
Through this project, I was able to demonstrate my understanding of the following:
HTML Boilerplate
How to link to another page
How to embed an image
How to create unordered and ordered lists
And of How to push my work to GitHub

I hope to revisit this in the future and see where I started and hopefully get a measure of how much I have learned.
